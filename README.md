# Nx MonoRepo starter project

A solid starting point for your new Nx based MonoRepo.

## What's included?

- pnpm workspace
- Nx
- semantic-release
- GitHub Actions for linting PR title with Conventional Commit rules, CI &
  Release
- Arc42 documentation template with Astro Starlight

## Getting Started

1. Run the following command to create a new project-name

   `npx degit https://github.com/froko/nx-monorepo <project-name>`

2. Run `pnpm install`

3. Change into the project directory and create a first commit with

   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "chore: initial commit"
   ```

4. Make it yours by changing some information in the following files
   - `README.json`
   - `package.json` (name, description, author, repository url)
   - `docs/astro.config.json` (title, social url)
   - `docs/src/content/docs/index.mdx` (title)

5. Commit your changes

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "chore: update project information"
   ```

6. Start adding projects and libraries

## Available commands on the root level

- `pnpm install` - Install all dependencies
- `pnpm format` - Format all projects
- `pnpm lint` - Lint all projects
- `pnpm build` - Build all projects
- `pnpm test` - Run all tests
- `pnpm affected` - Lint, Build & Test all affected projects
- `pnpm all` - Lint, Build & Test all projects

## Workspace structure

By default, the pnpm workspace comes with preconfigured directories for `apps`
and `libs`. You can add more directories or change the default ones by modifying
the `pnpm-workspace.yaml` file. Nx will automatically adhere to these changes.

## Adding AI assistant support

Nx can configure your repository for AI coding assistants. It sets up the Nx MCP
server, shared skills and an `AGENTS.md` (or assistant-specific instruction
file) so the assistant understands the workspace.

```bash
# Interactively pick the assistants to configure
pnpm exec nx configure-ai-agents

# Or configure specific ones non-interactively
pnpm exec nx configure-ai-agents --agents claude codex copilot --no-interactive

# Check whether existing configurations are up to date
pnpm exec nx configure-ai-agents --check
```

Supported agents include `claude`, `codex`, `copilot`, `cursor`, `gemini` and
`opencode`. Re-run the command after upgrading Nx to keep the generated
configuration current.
